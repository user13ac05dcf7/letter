# Changelog

All notable changes to Letter are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

How we maintain it:

- During development, add bullets under **[Unreleased](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD)**.
- On each release (rc or stable), rename that section to the version + date, and
copy a short summary into `data/io.github.stalvatero.Letter.metainfo.xml.in.in`
(`<releases>`, leave msgstr empty in po files — keep release notes in English)
and the GitHub Release notes.
- Prefer user-visible changes (features, fixes, translations). Skip internal
refactors unless they affect behaviour.



## [Unreleased](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD)


### Fixed

- Folder, message, and conversation rows are released when they leave the
  list. Opening many conversations no longer keeps those rows in memory.
  Reported by [Jake](https://github.com/user13ac05dcf7).
- Gmail’s Important folder drops messages that are no longer important,
  including when that folder is large. Those messages no longer stay marked
  important in other folders. Reported by [Illya Yalovyy](https://github.com/IllyaYalovyy).
- After a Microsoft 365 move, the old item id is dropped from the destination
  folder. Opening a leftover row opens the copy that arrived with the move,
  instead of saying the message is still syncing.


## [1.0.0](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0-rc.5...v1.0.0) - 2026-10-05


### Changed

- Opening a folder shows the messages already saved on disk. The server is
  asked only about the folder you opened, and downloading message bodies
  follows the preference window, continuing next time from where it stopped.
- Search shows header matches immediately, then adds matches from message
  text already saved on disk.
- On Microsoft 365, an interrupted walk of a large Archive keeps the local
  summary already saved, instead of shrinking the folder.
- Opening a message reuses one reader. Switching mail is faster and no longer
  flashes black. On a computer with two graphics chips, Letter draws on the
  one that drives the screen.
- Scrolling a long message follows the wheel. The page no longer animates
  between notches and lag behind the mouse.
- The message text appears first. Inline pictures fill in afterwards, so a
  mail full of images can be read and scrolled before they have all loaded.
  Reply and forward still include those pictures.
- Letter is installed as a Flatpak. Downloaded message bodies stay on disk:
  the bundled Microsoft 365 library no longer deletes them after a week.
  The system evolution-ews package is still required for a Microsoft 365
  mailbox to appear. Spell checking and attachment preview stay optional.


### Fixed

- Letter could crash when marking the open message read or unread.
- Pressing Delete while the cursor is in the search field, or any text field,
  no longer deletes the open message.
- Opening a message that moved to another folder before sync had caught up
  looks it up in the folder it is in now, instead of reporting an error.
- A message whose saved copy ends in the middle of an inline image is
  downloaded again, so the picture is not left cut off.
- Clicking a message that has just arrived, while that folder is still
  syncing, shows the sender and subject from the list and waits for the body,
  instead of an empty message.
- Startup sync no longer stops for good on Archive when the server list is
  shorter than the one Letter already has, so Inbox still gets its turn.
- Downloading message bodies no longer holds up new mail when memory is high.



## [1.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0-rc.4...v1.0.0-rc.5) - 2026-09-18


### Translations

- Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (Thiago Haeitmann).


### Added

- Debian / Ubuntu `.deb` package on GitHub Releases alongside the Flatpak
  bundle (`Letter-…-amd64.deb`, package name `letter`).


### Fixed

- After every message of a conversation leaves the current folder (archive,
  move, or trash), list selection stays next to that conversation’s place in
  the list — anchored to its newest message there — instead of jumping near
  the oldest.


### Changed

- Compose no longer autosaves to Drafts every two minutes. Save with the
  toolbar button, or choose Save / Discard when closing; this avoids duplicate
  drafts especially with Microsoft 365 accounts.



## [1.0.0-rc.4](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0-rc.3...v1.0.0-rc.4) - 2026-09-17



### Added

- Right-click a To/Cc recipient chip in the message view for **Write to**
  (new compose) or **Copy Email**.
- Open `.eml` / `message/rfc822` files in a read-only viewer (no reply, forward,
  or other actions). Letter can register as a handler for those MIME types.
- Context menu **Save as EML…** on a single message exports it to a file you choose.
- Compose **High priority** toggle sets Importance / X-Priority headers.
- Multi-select preview shows bulk action buttons (Archive, Move, Mark as Read /
  Unread, Delete) instead of only instructional text.
- Compose context menu **Paste and Match Style** (also Ctrl+Shift+V) pastes
clipboard text using the font and size you are already typing with.
- Preferences **Aggregate sound** (on by default): one beep for all new mail in
a check cycle instead of a beep per message.



### Changed

- Opening **Drafts** does a short server tip refresh (with a small cooldown) so
a just-saved draft appears in Letter without waiting for the next mail check.
- Large Archive / Sent folders no longer keep retrying endless server refreshes  
when Microsoft 365 Online Archive makes message counts drift.
- Context menu **Update Folder** runs a thorough server high priority align for that folder. 
- Compose image-size controls ignore images inside the signature (and quoted
  mail); the signature editor still offers resize for its own images.



### Fixed

- Typing a recipient address and pressing Space turns it into a chip (or takes
  the autocomplete suggestion); display names without `@` still accept spaces.
- Compose keeps a single Drafts copy per message: later autosaves replace the
previous revision instead of leaving duplicates, and closing after further
edits asks to save those changes again. Opening Drafts also rebuilds from
Camel when even a single new local UID is missing from the list.
- Bulk **Mark All as Read** no longer blocks Send or draft save: flag upload
pauses for outbound mail, can be cancelled mid-flight, then resumes with the
remaining dirty SEEN flags still durable on disk.
- Compose format bar now shows the font, size, and bold/italic/underline/strike
under the caret or selection. Dropdowns clear when the face is not in Letter’s
font list or when the selection mixes different fonts or sizes.
- Compose / Sent recipient chips no longer glue bare addresses into the next
`Name <email>` entry when the To list mixes plain emails and display names
(also repairs “Send again” and older mangled Sent headers when possible).
- Compose recipient field no longer storms the GDK frame clock with continuous
layout requests while typing addresses (WrapBox + expanding entry).



## [1.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0-rc.2...v1.0.0-rc.3) - 2026-09-14



### Added

- Soft archive / move / copy / flag changes are written to an on-disk mutation
registry. Pending work stays durable across crash, offline use, and restarts
instead of living only in RAM.
- Compose autosave every 2 minutes into the account **Drafts** folder (local
Camel store; server upload follows the normal sync interval). Toast once per
compose window.
- Virtual **Outbox**: Send writes the message to disk first, then delivers on
an isolated retry pump (badge, Edit / Send Now / Cancel Send). Sending no
longer waits behind Archive body sync.



### Changed

- Opening a folder is cache-first (disk/Camel local); server header sync runs
on F5, the mail-check timer, scout, or when the local list is clearly
incomplete while online. Status “Updating…” stays for the open folder / F5.
- Large folders (Archive, Sent, custom bulk): scout uses short, widening
budgets instead of a full 90s `refresh_info` every cycle, with backoff after
a failed full attempt. Sent/Drafts also get a periodic tip refresh.
- Empty Trash / Junk and permanent deletes use Camel `synchronize` then
`expunge` where needed. Microsoft 365 repairs missing Trash/Junk folder type
flags and hard-deletes Junk via Trash.
- Archive / delete / flag apply in the UI immediately; Graph push waits for the
sync timer, F5, startup, or a timed quit flush so Send stays responsive.
- Recipient chips require a real `user@domain` address. Outbox surfaces the
first send failure immediately.
- Inline compose images (insert, drag-drop, clipboard paste) are sent as
`multipart/related` CID parts instead of raw `data:` URIs.
- Flatpak ships a minimal Evolution + `evolution-ews` stack so Microsoft 365
Graph mail works in the sandbox (bundle is larger). Host `evolution-ews`
remains useful for Calendar/Contacts. UI translations ship inside the
bundle; new Flatpak / first-sync strings translated for Italian and German.
- Folder pane shows live activity (Updating… / Sending… / Downloading…). Body
prefetch pauses when a send is waiting. Hung Graph folder refreshes are
time-bounded so they cannot block reading forever.



### Fixed

- Opening a folder no longer forces a server refresh on every click (that broke
offline browsing and cancelled work when switching folders).
- Startup no longer skips the first Inbox sync when opening a folder preempts
the folder-tree job.
- Microsoft 365 Archive moves no longer hang for minutes on one message;
Letter freezes the Camel folders around the transfer so moves finish in
seconds and can run in bulk.
- Microsoft 365 Empty Junk and permanent deletes from Trash no longer come
back after sync.
- Large Archive (and similar) folders no longer stay stuck on a stale local
header list when Camel already has many more UIDs; opening the folder
rebuilds the list.
- Sending could stick on “Sending…” forever while Archive body download held
Camel; send can now finish even when background work was stuck.
- Preferences “Download message bodies” applies to every folder, not only
Inbox.
- Flatpak Dependencies page correctly detects host `evolution-ews` and Sushi;
Online Accounts / Calendar / Contacts menu actions open the host apps over
D-Bus.
- Folders with unread/total hints but no local headers yet show an “aligning
local cache” wait state instead of looking empty during first sync.



## [1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/compare/v1.0.0-rc.1...v1.0.0-rc.2) - 2026-09-09



### Added

- Compact “Important message” badge for high-priority mail (sender Importance);
list/thread icons only — no user toggle on Microsoft accounts.
- Localized search operators via gettext (`contains:` / `from:` / `to:` plus
Italian `contiene:` / `da:` / `a:` and German `enthält:` / `von:` / `an:`);
English operators always work.



### Changed

- AppStream release notes stay English in translations (leave msgstr empty) so
translators are not asked to update them on every release.



### Fixed

- Microsoft 365 bookmarks map to Outlook Flag (follow-up), not High Importance;
flag push uses Camel `folder.synchronize`, and marking read no longer wipes a
remote Flag.
- Meeting invitation times use the event timezone (no more +2h shift in Rome).
- Invitation UI strings are included in gettext again.
- Accept/Decline update the UI and move the invite to Trash immediately; calendar
sync continues in the background.



### Translations

- German UI completed (Christian Lauinger), including Gmail Labels, well-known
folder names, undo toasts, and cache-loading strings.



## [1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/stalvatero/letter/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1) - 2026-09-08



### Added

- First Flatpak bundle for GitHub Releases (GNOME Platform 50; not on Flathub yet).
- Undo toast for archive, move, and trash.
- CI validation on Fedora 44.



### Changed

- Startup always opens Inbox for the last selected account (folder selection is
no longer restored).
- Cache-first folder trees and message lists for faster account switching.



### Fixed

- Folder-tree disk cache writes after the cache directory already exists.
- Thread focus after archiving a message inside a conversation.
- Localized well-known folder names (Drafts, Sent, …) in the UI locale.
